    <h1 class="cursive">Hi!</h1>
    <p>I'm Nicole.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for stories.  I enjoy how lines of code can be woven together to build beautiful and useful products.
      I like to code every day to learn new things and solidify what I already know.  The projects listed below are all works in progress.

          <h2>Thyme</h2>
          <p>
            A simple time tracking and invoice generating tool for freelancers. This group project was built while at the Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp.
            As a group, we decided to challenge ourselves and learn new libraries, this included Redux Toolkit and Chakra UI.  My role was Git Keeper, which 
            involved communicating with my team about pull requests and preserving the integrity of our code. My group is currently refactoring and converting it 
            into TypeScript, so our deployed site is currently down.

          <h2>Beanbot</h2>
          <p>
            A chatbot built with JavaScript, React, Redux, and Regular Expressions.  This personal project was created while studying at Dev Academy.  I had tons of fun building 
            this and enjoyed learning Regular Expressions and Spline, both of which were outside of the curriculum.  I intend to keep working on this project to add 
            more features, expand the database, improve test coverage, and refine the design.
